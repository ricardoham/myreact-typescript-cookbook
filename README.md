# My React TypeScript Cookbook

A monorepo with my react "cookbook formula"

## Working in progress ⚠️

### Obs to Skip CRA preflight check since Nx manages the monorepo and need nx globally installed

`echo "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" > .env`

Since this project was created by using CRA you need to navigate to:
` /myreact-typescript-cookbook` and run `yarn` or `npm install`

Then run on root folder of monorepo `nx serve myreact-typescript-cookbook`
